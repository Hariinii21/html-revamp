        <p>A car, or an automobile, is a motor vehicle with wheels. 
            Most definitions of cars state that they run primarily on roads, 
            seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people over cargo.
            [1][2] There are around one billion cars in use worldwide. The car is considered 
            an essential part of the developed economy.[3]The French inventor Nicolas-Joseph 
            Cugnot built the first steam-powered road vehicle in 1769, while the Swiss inventor 
            François Isaac de Rivaz designed and constructed the first internal combustion-powered
             automobile in 1808. The modern car—a practical, marketable automobile for everyday 
             use—was invented in 1886, when the German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz 
             Patent-Motorwagen.</p>
